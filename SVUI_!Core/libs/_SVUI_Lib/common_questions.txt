How do I set health values to percent?

Go into options ("/sv") and click UnitFrames on the left.
Then click on any unit you would like to change.
Once those options appear, click the dropdown box on the upper right and select "Health".
Now scroll down and look under "Text Settings" for the option "Text Format".
Click that dropdown and you will see the "percent" options among others.
