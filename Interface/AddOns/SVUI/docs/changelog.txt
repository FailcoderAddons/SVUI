v5.2: MANY CHANGES!!!
-------------------------------------
Added/Redesigned
-------------------------------------
> Raid frames are now singular, meaning there will no longer be separate frames for sizes 10/15/20/25/40. In the config menu you will only see one category called "Raid".

> Docks have undergone major changes to how they are built and function.
    NOTE 1: Before, docklets and dock features were created in static positions (ie... chat tabs on the left, profession tools and henchmen on the right..etc) and the dock holders were essentially just anchored placeholders with little purpose other than a starting point for child elements. Now every aspect of each docking cluster is dynamic and interchangeable. 
    NOTE 2: Utilizing the new dock system is restricted to internal code at this time. If you have questions please ask me and I will walk you through them.
    NOTE 3: I have added an alt-click menu to each dock icon that allows you to re-order its position in it's current dock. 
    NOTE 4: All movement changes are now being saved and retained per character.

> Dock alerts (ie.. chat edit box and Laborer "End Mode" button) are attractive now ;)

> Micro Menu bar has been relocated to the upper left corner of the screen, mouse over it to show (can be changed in settings)

> Stats have been changed slightly
    NOTE 1: The top stat bar is now anchored to the top center of the screen (was top left)
    NOTE 2: The top stat bar is also NAKED by default (ie.. no stats showing/assigned). I felt like having too much on screen for new users was confusing.
    NOTE 3: Backgrounds are disabled now by default (can still be changed in settings)
    NOTE 4: Changed the default stat assignment for the bottom bar to improve asthetics. (Courtesy of Penguinsane)

> Installer updated. Now when making aura layout selections you will see dummy aura icons and bars to help visualize the changes.

> Slightly re-styled tooltips to make them less intrusive by removing the POW graphic from the bottom of the frame. Seemed like too much at times.

> NEW: Round style for minimaps that use the "rotateMinimap" interface option.

> REMOVED: WorldMap movement alpha settings. Blizzard has a built-in function for this now under your Interface options.

-------------------------------------
Fixes

> WorldMap issues with elements becoming unclickable are fixed
> WorldMap tooltip issues are fixed

-- Un-docked chat windows will now have a skinned background to improve visibility.
-- Fixed a bad string in the installer file
-- Removed the "Ace3" style from StyleOMatic. Rather than attempt to skin ALL ace config windows (which is NOT resource friendly), I decided to directly modify the lib itself. The config libraries will be replaced in the near future for a much lighter alternative.
-- Removed the config option to change classbar width, this was added as an option but never implemented. Changed the option for classbar height to now be "Size" which is essentially what it has always been.

-- Completely forgot to include frame positions in the profile saving process, my bad yo!
-- Almost forgot filter changes, this caused an error but is fixed now.
-- Completely repaired and finalized the new internal config system, this will remove all setting based bugs you may have encountered
-- Found and removed issues that were causing memory leaks in both the Stats and Unit packages
-- Fixed autoscaling, raid frame hiding (just re-iterating that fact) and a handful of other issues

IMPORTANT------

-- New profiles (WARNING: old settings WILL be erased due to changes in the core). Unlike previous versions as well as many other UI's available, SVUI will handle profiles on an as-needed basis. What this means is that if you want to be able to use the same profile from one character to the next then you will have to go into the settings "/sv" and then the "profiles" tab on the left. Once you are there you will need to "SAVE" that current characters profile (this will no longer be automatic as that pollutes the global variables file). After you have saved your profile, you can then log onto another character and select the saved profile from the "Copy" dropdown list. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that once you are satisfied with and profile duplications you have done, you should then select the unneeded saved profile from the "Delete" dropdown to remove it. This does not affect any character that has already received a copy as the used copies are stored in another location.
